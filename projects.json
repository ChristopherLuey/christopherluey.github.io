        "detailedDescription": "<p>This project involves simulating a gymnastics high bar dismount solving the Euler-Lagrange Equations and using numerical simulation techniques. The system is modeled with two rigid bodies representing the human arms and torso, each with defined volume and mass.</p><p>The simulation is divided into two phases:</p><ul><li><strong>Phase One (Double Pendulum):</strong> The simulation begins with the bodies in a vertically upright position and initial angular velocities. The arms (Body B) rotate around the high bar (2.8m high) until a specified release angle is reached. This phase employs the Euler-Lagrange equation to model the dynamics and constraints using variational calculus to derive the equations of motion.</li><li><strong>Phase Two (Projectile Motion):</strong> Upon reaching the release angle, the constraint on the arms is removed, and both bodies follow a projectile trajectory. The simulation continues until a plastic impact is detected when the torso (Body D) hits the ground. The impact is considered successful when both corners of the torso contact the ground simultaneously.</li></ul><p>The simulation leverages numerical methods, including symbolic computation SymPy for the Euler-Lagrange equations and numerical solvers for the projectile motion phase, to ensure accurate and realistic modeling of the dismount. Transformations between different reference frames are handled using rotational matrices to account for the orientation and position of the rigid bodies. Variational calculus is applied to derive the governing equations from the Lagrangian, which is the difference between kinetic and potential energy of the system.</p>",

        "detailedDescription": "<p>This project involved developing a controller for the youBot mobile manipulator, featuring a 5R joint arm on a base with 4 mecanum wheels. The primary objective was to enable the manipulator to pick up and place a cube at designated initial and final configurations.</p><p>The project incorporated several key techniques, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Odometry:</strong> Used for accurately determining the robot's position over time.</li><li><strong>Feedback Control:</strong> Implemented to ensure the manipulator follows the desired trajectory.</li><li><strong>Trajectory Planning:</strong> Developed to generate smooth and feasible paths for the end-effector.</li></ul><p>The project was divided into milestones, each focusing on different aspects of the controller:</p><ul><li><strong>Milestone 1:</strong> Implemented the NextStep function for basic control logic.</li><li><strong>Milestone 2:</strong> Developed the TrajectoryGeneration function to create desired paths.</li><li><strong>Milestone 3:</strong> Created the FeedbackControl function to minimize error along the trajectory.</li></ul><p>Three main configurations were tested:</p><ul><li><strong>Best Configuration:</strong> Tuned feedforward plus P controller with gains Kp = 0.4 I6x6 per second and Ki = 0 per second squared. Achieved minimal error throughout the trajectory.</li><li><strong>Overshoot Configuration:</strong> Feedforward plus PI controller with gains Kp = 0.6 I6x6 per second and Ki = 0.4 I6x6 per second squared. Noted overshoot and oscillation before stabilizing.</li><li><strong>New Task Configuration:</strong> Feedforward plus PI controller for a different set of initial and final positions with gains Kp = 2.0 I6x6 per second and Ki = 0.05 I6x6 per second squared. Demonstrated high accuracy in pick and place maneuvers.</li></ul><p>Additional enhancements included Jacobian singularity avoidance to prevent large velocities by setting near-singular values to zero. This resulted in smoother motion and better overall performance.</p><p>Skills learned and applied in this project include advanced control theory, robotic kinematics and dynamics, numerical methods, and proficiency in Python programming for robotic applications.</p>",
